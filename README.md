# Waves App

## What is it?

A lightweight music playback web application. Intended as purely an exercise in React and HTMl/CSS principles.

## Tell me more...

This is a project that was part of [Dev Ed's](https://developedbyed.com/) Creative React and Redux Course. For the most part, the code is similar to what was prescribed in the project so no credit is taken for the idea or the structure of the application. This project was simply to observe Dev Ed's strategy of setting up a React App and gather ideas regarding CSS styling for a future project with similar functionality.

# Project Status

This project is complete and no further updates will be made. It is not intended for production or third-party use.

# Personal Comments

To supplement my existing HTML/CSS/JS/React knowledge, I'm in the process of taking [Dev Ed's](https://developedbyed.com) Creative React and Redux Course. The reason why is to see how another developer structures a React application and how they might approach a coding problem. This project in particular was interesting because it utilizes the implements audio playback which has its own quirks regarding the build-in methods for the `<audio>` tag. In addition, this was my first time implementing Sass for styling in a React app. Previously, I've always used in-line styling in the JSX code. Some other topics covered in this project included the concept of 'lifting state', `useRef`, `useEffect` and the use of basic CSS animations.
